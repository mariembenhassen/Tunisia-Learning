# ðŸ“š Tunisia Learning Mobile App  

### **Overview**  
Tunisia Learning is a mobile application developed to enhance accessibility in educational systems. The app bridges the gap between parents, teachers, and school administrations by providing a seamless, mobile-first experience for real-time communication, document management, and student tracking.  

Built during my summer internship at **Delta Web IT**, the app integrates directly with an existing PHP backend and database, ensuring consistency and a unified experience for users.
